## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Complete Tax Optimization Engine**: Implement the tax optimization engine to provide recommendations for tax-efficient RSU management.
2. **Improve Data Validation**: Implement validation for user inputs and uploaded data.
3. **Enhance Manual Data Entry**: Add more validation and guidance for manually entered data.
4. **Further Visualization Enhancements**: Add additional visualization types like pie charts or line charts for trend analysis.

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Multi-Company Support**: Enhance the application to support RSUs from multiple companies.
2. **Data Persistence**: Implement options for saving user data between sessions.
3. **Improve PDF Reports**: Enhance the PDF reports with more detailed information and better formatting.

### Long-term Enhancements
1. **Integration with Financial APIs**: Consider integrating with financial APIs for real-time stock prices.
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Evaluate how the application performs on mobile devices.
3. **User Authentication**: Add user authentication for secure data storage.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
1. **Module Organization**: The tax calculation logic has been moved to a separate module (`tax_engine.py`) for better maintainability and reusability.
2. **Column Naming Convention**: Standardized column names across the application to ensure consistency.
3. **Error Handling Strategy**: Added robust error handling for cases when data is missing or invalid.
4. **Flexible Column Naming**: Enhanced the application to handle multiple column naming conventions for better user experience.
5. **Data Entry Approach**: Implemented direct data grid editing for more flexible data management.

### User Experience Considerations
1. **Data Entry Flexibility**: Users can now load sample data, upload their own Excel files, or manually enter data directly in the application.
2. **Simplified Interface**: Removed duplicate data grids to make the interface cleaner and more intuitive.
3. **Guided Tax Preparation**: The EOY Tax Return Assistant provides step-by-step guidance for tax preparation.
4. **Interactive Data Management**: Added buttons for clearing data and enabled direct data grid editing for better user control.
5. **Enhanced Data Visualization**: Implemented professional-looking charts with consistent styling to help users better understand their financial data.
6. **Focused Visual Insights**: Removed redundant visualizations and focused on the most valuable financial comparisons.

### Testing Priorities
1. **Calculation Accuracy**: Verify that all tax calculations are accurate across different scenarios.
2. **Edge Cases**: Test with various data inputs, including empty datasets and unusual values.
3. **User Workflow Testing**: Ensure that the application guides users effectively through the tax preparation process.
4. **Data Persistence**: Verify that manually entered and edited data persists correctly in the session state.
5. **Column Name Handling**: Test with various column naming conventions to ensure the application handles them correctly.
